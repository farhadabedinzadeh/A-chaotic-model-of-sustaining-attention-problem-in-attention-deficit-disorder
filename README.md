# A chaotic model of sustaining attention problem in attention deficit disorder


The inability to maintain focus is one of the most prevalent signs of attention deficit disorder. A lack of dopamine is presented as one of the reasons of this illness.
This script is a part of a paper which presents a behavioral model based on physiological facts regarding the attention regulation system and chaotic intermittency. This model exemplifies the problem of unintended shifts in attention level and is able to make many significant predictions on a potential etiology of attention deficit disorder. The suggested model suggests a probable interaction between neurotransmitters that helps the individual control attention switching in an adaptive manner over time. This study's findings can be utilized to evaluate and design a new, more effective solution for the difficulty of maintaining attention.
